properties:
    softstart:
      type: uint8-array
      required: false
      description: Booster soft start values

    orientation-flipped:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Last column address is mapped to first segment

    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: RESET pin.

        The RESET pin of SSD16XX is active low.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

    dc-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: DC pin.

        The DC pin of SSD16XX is active low (transmission command byte).
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

    busy-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: BUSY pin.

        The BUSY pin of SSD16XX is active high.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active high.

    tssv:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: Temperature Sensor Selection Value

        Display controller can have integrated temperature sensor or
        an external temperature sensor is connected to the controller.
        The value selects which sensor should be used.

child-binding:
    description: |
      Child nodes describe refresh profiles. Each refresh profile
      specifies a set of voltages used to drive the refresh
      cycle. Refresh profiles are optional and are used to override
      defaults loaded from the controllers OTP memory.

      Partial refresh will be disabled unless a partial refresh
      profile has been specified. That profile may be empty to use the
      defaults loaded from OTP if supported by the device.

      The driver typically looks for the following child nodes:

        - 'full' - Normal / full refresh.
        - 'partial' - Partial refresh.
